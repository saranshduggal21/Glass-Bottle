# Glass-Bottlea

Glass Bottle is an app that works across all iOS devices that allows users to scan any cosmetic or skincare product, in order break down and analyze exactly how safe or harmful that product truly is.

Glass Bottle uses Swift as its primary language, with a combination of Ruby.

Glass Bottle uses Machine Learning (Vision Framework + custom-trained NLP Classification Algorithm), Camera Operations, Realm Sync (for a dynamic database that updates on every user's phone), MongoDB Atlas, various databases & APIs, and an interactive UI in order to perform its various operations.
